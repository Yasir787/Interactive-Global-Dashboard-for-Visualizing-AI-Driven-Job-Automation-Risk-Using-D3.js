            As artificial intelligence continues to advance at an unprecedented
            pace, the question of whether AI creates or destroys jobs has become
            one of the most pressing concerns of our time.             While proponents
            argue that AI will generate new opportunities as it enhances
            productivity, much like previous technological advancements, an
            examination of the data reveals more troubling trends. This
            scrollytelling page explores how AI automation is fundamentally
            reshaping the job market and how many of the jobs we rely on are at
            substantial risk of being automated.

          <h2>Understanding the Risk Landscape</h2>
          <p>
            The scatter plot above maps thousands of jobs based on their
            automation risk and growth rate. Each dot represents a specific
            occupation, with its position showing how vulnerable it is to AI
            automation (horizontal axis) and its projected growth (vertical
            axis). The color of each dot indicates the AI impact level—red for
            high impact, orange for moderate, and green for low impact.
          </p>

        <section class="text-section">
          <h2>The Uncomfortable Truth: A Massive Number of Jobs Are at Risk</h2>
          <p>
            What becomes immediately apparent when examining this visualization
            is that massive cross section of jobs are at risk, from Fast food
            restaurant managers to Sales executives an incredible section of our
            occupations are at risk. Even high skill/education jobs such as
            literal executives are at risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data reveals that jobs requiring advanced education and offering
            substantial compensation are not immune to automation. In fact, many
            professional roles in managment, legal services, finance, and
            technology are high-risk, with specific examples including the
            aforementioned sales executives, materials engineers, investment
            analysts, etc. Workers who have invested years in education and
            career development may find their roles increasingly automated, with
            AI systems capable of performing complex decision-making tasks that
            were once the exclusive domain of human professionals, steadily
            reducing the need for human workers.

          <h2>Understanding Risk by Industry</h2>
          <p>
            The industry bar chart above shows the average automation risk by
            industry. The x-axis is the industry name and the y-axis is the
            average automation risk. The color of the bars indicates the AI

          <h2>The Most at Risk Industries</h2>
          <p>
            Besides specific jobs that are at risk, the industry bar chart above
            indicates that while essentially all industries face substantial
            AI risk, some industries are much more impacted than others.
            While some sectors like education are likely to receive
            minimal impact, finance in particular faces high risk of massive
            disruption, and with it significant job loss. A large selection of other industries
            are also at risk, though to a lesser degree, such as entertainment and
            healthcare. This data helps drive home that a massive variety and
            number of jobs are at risk, including those in industries that
            might be considered most desirable, such as finance.

            The radar chart above reveals the comprehensive threat that AI poses
            across different sectors. Each polygon represents an sector of the
            economy, with its shape showing how vulnerable that sector is across
            multiple dimensions: automation risk, AI exposure, wage pressure,
            reskilling gaps, and job security loss. The larger the polygon, the
            more comprehensively that industry faces disruption.

        <section class="text-section">
          <h2>AI Encroaches on Every Sector</h2>
          <p>
            The emergence of ChatGPT and similar LLMs in late 2022 marked a
            turning point. Unlike previous automation that replaced manual or
            routine tasks, these systems can perform cognitive work that was
            previously thought to be uniquely human. Customer support roles,
            which appear prominently in the radar chart with high AI exposure
            scores, have been particularly hard hit. But it is not the only
            sector at risk, while some sectors are (relatively) safe, such as
            education and creative industries, the majority have high risk
            ratings across the board and all stand to lose jobs(and wages) to
            AI. Some sectors in particular, manufacturing, retail, and admin,
            have a high reskilling gap, meaning that workers in these sectors
            will have a hard time transitioning to new roles, and may even be
            left behind as their skills become obsolete.

          <p>
            The flames visualization above represents the global scale of AI's
            recent boom. Each circle represents a country, positioned within
            flame layers that correspond to their level of AI adoption and the
            corresponding job risk. The size of each circle reflects the

            Countries in the red "High" layer, including China, the United

            adopted AI technologies. These nations represent billions of workers
            whose jobs are now in jeopardy. The visualization makes clear that
            this is not a localized problem, AI proliferation stands to create a

        <section class="text-section">
          <h2>Scale and Speed: Why This Time Is Different</h2>
          <p>
            Historical technological disruptions, from the Industrial Revolution
            to the computer age, created new jobs even as they eliminated old
            ones. However, the current 'AI revolution' is fundamentally
            different in both scale and speed. The flames visualization shows
            that countries representing a massive proportion of the world's
            population are in the high-risk category, and this transition is
            happening not over decades, but over years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scale of this transition is also unprecedented, as unlike
            previous technological shifts, AI is not just augmenting human
            capabilities, but sometimes replacing them entirely (e.g., generating summaries
            of research papers in seconds, even if at lower quality, where a human
            would have to spend hours reading and summarizing the paper). This
            fundamental shift from augmentation to replacement is what turns the scale of AI adoption into a potential crisis.

          <h2>Global Risk Map: No Country Is Immune</h2>
          <p>
            The world map above visualizes average automation risk by country.
            Use the dropdown menu to filter by specific job titles and see how
            different occupations face varying levels of risk across different

            percentages for the job selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            What becomes immediately apparent is that automation risk is
            remarkably consistent across countries, about 49-51% globally. This
            narrow range is itself telling: it suggests that AI's impact on jobs
            is not dependent on a country's level of development, economic
            system, or labor regulations. Whether in developed economies like
            the United States and United Kingdom, or emerging markets, the
            threat of automation looms equally large.

        <section class="text-section">
          <h2>The Borderless Nature of AI Job Destruction</h2>
          <p>
            The geographic visualization underscores a critical point: AI-driven job loss respects no borders. Unlike previous waves of 
            automation that primarily affected manufacturing in specific regions, AI technologies, especially cloud-based LLMs like 
            ChatGPT and its alternatives, can be deployed instantly and simultaneously across the globe. A company in New York can replace customer service 
            workers in India, a firm in London can automate data analysis that once required analysts in multiple countries, and a 
            startup in San Francisco can eliminate roles that previously existed in dozens of nations.
          </p>
          <p>
            This borderless nature means that workers cannot simply relocate to avoid automation. The map shows that whether you're in a 
            high income country with strong labor protections or a developing economy, the automation risk remains consistently high. The 
            proliferation of AI has created a global labor market disruption where geographic advantages offer little protection. Workers 
            everywhere face the same fundamental challenge: adapting to an economy where AI can perform an expanding range of tasks 
            previously reserved for human intelligence.

            job, orbiting around a country center in rings that correspond to different industry sectors. 
            The size of each star reflects its automation risk, larger stars face higher risk, while the color 
            indicates AI impact level with green for low impact, yellow for moderate, and red for high impact.

            Click on any sector's orbit label to toggle between grouped and spread views, revealing 
            how jobs within that industry are distributed. Hover over individual stars to see more detailed information 
            about each job's risk profile in tooltip form.

          <h2>The Inescapable Conclusion: AI's Path of Destruction</h2>
          <p>
            As we trace through these visualizations, from the individual jobs at risk, to larger industries under threat, 
            to global patterns of adoption, and finally to the complex constellation of employment  
            a pattern emerges. AI is not merely changing the job market, it is systematically 
            dismantling it across multiple dimensions simultaneously. These visualizations show that automation risk is not 
            isolated to low skill positions or specific sectors, but now permeate every level of the economy, from 
            entry-level service jobs to executive positions, from manufacturing to finance to healthcare.
          </p>
          <p>
            The relatively recent large language models like ChatGPT, Deepseek, and Gemni, have accelerated this 
            destruction to a unprecedented pace. Unlike previous technological revolutions that created new industries 
            and employment opportunities faster than it reduced them, current AI systems are designed to replace human cognitive labor,
            the very foundation of most modern employment, and certainly the best modern employment.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI is causing or will cause substantial job losses across the globe, across industries, and across skill 
            levels. Without significant intervention, policy changes, and a fundamental rethinking of how we value human labor in 
            an our economy, millions of workers face displacement with few viable alternatives.
